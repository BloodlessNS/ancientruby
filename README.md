# Pokémon Ancient Ruby/Sapphire

This is a custom Pokémon game based on [the Pokémon Crystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal).

The goal of this project is to build a realistic recreation of the GBA titles Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire on the GBC using custom devamps of the art and music of the original games.
Inspired by the rmxp game [Pokémon Ancient Emerald](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=296411) by Pia Carrot, which in turn was inspired by the Silver hack
Pokémon Ancient Emerald(http://www.romhack.me/ancientemerald/) by Melash. This version of the hack began art production around 2015 and began official work on mapping and scripting
January 2018.
